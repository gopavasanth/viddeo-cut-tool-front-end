### Install Docker

The tool uses docker to install and run everything with a single command.

Install docker from this link: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

### Clone Repo

Run these commands to clone the code from the remote repo.

```

git clone "https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/labs/tools/VideoCutTool"

cd ./VideoCutTool

```

### Run environment

Run this command inside VideoCutTool to start development docker container.

`docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.dev.yml up --build`

The first time you run it will take some time 4-8 minutes (depending on your internet speed) because it will pull the necessary images from docker and install NPM packages. Once it is up and running changes will be hot loaded.

> Note: anytime you update package.json the build process will take a while.

To run production you can run this command

`docker-compose -f .\docker-compose.prd.yml up -d`
